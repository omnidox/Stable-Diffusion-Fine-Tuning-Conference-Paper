# **Personalizing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models**

## **Overview**
This paper delves into the realm of text-to-image diffusion models, emphasizing their potential in applications such as photo personalization, movie animations, and their broader impacts on AI in smart cities. The study presents methods and models, including Stable Diffusion, Hypernetworks, and DreamBooth.

## **Organization**
- **Section 2**: Explains the models and methods used, namely, Stable Diffusion, Hypernetworks, and DreamBooth.
- **Section 3**: Describes the implementations of the proposed approaches along with algorithms.
- **Section 4**: Provides a synopsis of the experimental evaluation and a discussion.
- **Section 5**: Overviews related work in the area, placing the study in context, and emphasizing its novelty.
- **Section 6**: Concludes the paper and outlines prospective avenues for future research.

## **Comparative Observations**
A pilot study was conducted comparing different fine-tuning models:
- **Hypernetwork**: Uses 8GB V-RAM on a personal computer with 10,000 steps. The class is affected by the subject.
- **DreamBooth**: Uses 24GB V-RAM on Google Colab with 4,040 steps. The class is distinct from the subject.
